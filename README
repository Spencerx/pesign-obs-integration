Signing kernel modules and EFI binaries in the Open Build Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Packages that need to sign files during build should add the following lines
to the specfile

# needssslcertforbuild
export BRP_PESIGN_FILES='pattern...'
BuildRequires: pesign-obs-integration

The "# needssslcertforbuild" comment tells the buildservice to store the
signing certificate in %_sourcedir/_projectcert.crt. At the end of the
install phase, the brp-99-pesign script computes hashes of all
files matching the patterns in $BRP_PESIGN_FILES. The sha256 hashes are stored
in %_topdir/OTHER/%name.cpio.rsasign, plus the script places a
pesign-repackage.spec file there. When the first rpmbuild finishes, the
buildservice sends the cpio archive to the signing server, which returns
a rsasigned.cpio archive with RSA signatures of the sha256 hashes.

The pesign-repackage.spec takes the original RPMs, unpacks them and
appends the signatures to the files. It then uses the
pesign-gen-repackage-spec script to generate another specfile, which
builds new RPMs with signed files. The supported file types are:

/lib/firmware/* - Detached signature in $file.sig
*.ko            - Signature appended to the module
efi binaries    - Signature embedded in a header
